A challenge that I found on frontend mentor (intermediate diffculty)

## Features

- just a good looking landing page
- one of the beautiest website I have made

## Technologies

- React
- Next js

## Notes

- The code may not be well formulated because I was beginning to learn how to use next js and scss modules
